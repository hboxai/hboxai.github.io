    Tablet or Bluetooth transmitting device or mobile app; any one or more FDA-approved
    medical devices – blood pressure monitor, blood glucose monitor, pulse oximeter,
    weight scale, spirometer, thermometer, etc., and accessories collectively called as
    HBox Kit. The kit uses Wi-Fi or cellular connectivity to transmit data. Medical providers
    use Platform and HBox Kit given to you to collect psychological data and monitor your
    health remotely. You and your medical provider will decide how long you should
    participate in the program. The HBox Kit will be yours to use for the duration of your
    participation in the program. The HBox Kit is the proprietary property of HBox. You
    may not allow anyone else to use the HBox Kit. Each HBox Kit will transmit your
    physiological data to HBox through appropriate cellular connections or Wi-fi. This data
    will be loaded into a secure web portal (“Platform”), which your medical provider will
    access. The Platform is secure and HIPAA compliant.
    <br/> <br/>
